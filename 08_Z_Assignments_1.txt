Your company is ready to start using Docker on some of their servers. In order to get started, they want you to set up and configure Docker CE on a server that has already been set up. You will need to make sure that the server meets the following specifications:

Docker CE is installed and running on the server.
Use Docker CE version 5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic.
Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands.
The default logging driver is set to syslog.


[NOTE: Write the series of commands to achieve above in this file below the question scenario with documentation]


Good luck!



1.Docker Installation on server.
  Install reqired packages.
sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
  Add the Docker GPG key and repo
     Commands:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
  
  Install Docker CE packages
     Command:
 sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic docker-ce-cli=5:18.09.5~3-0~ubuntu-bionic containerd.io

2.Any non-root user has permission to run docker commands

  sudo usermod -a -G docker ubuntu (Here my user is ubuntu)
ubuntu@ip-172-31-82-56:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

3.The default logging driver is set to syslog
 added deamon.json file under /etc/docke/ location and restart the docker.
root@ip-172-31-82-56:/etc/docker# docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'
json-file
